# Deepfake Video Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting deepfake videos shared on social media platforms. Deepfake videos, which are manipulated to mislead or distort information, can lead to harmful outcomes like criticism, conflicts, and misinformation. Our framework uses **Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to identify and classify deepfake content efficiently.

### Key Steps:
1. **Preprocessing**: Videos are divided into frames, which are normalized and enhanced for better input quality.
2. **Feature Extraction**: A deep CNN extracts key features from the frames.
3. **Classification**: The model, trained on authentic and deepfake videos, identifies manipulated content.

### Features:
- High accuracy in detecting deepfake videos.
- Low false-positive rate.
- Resilient to adversarial attacks and adaptable to new deepfake techniques.

### Objective:
To build an automated, reliable, and efficient framework for detecting deepfake videos using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques.

### Benefits:
This project helps individuals, organizations, and platforms combat deceptive content, promoting trust and safety in the digital world.
